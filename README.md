# Modern LMS (Name TBD)

A **next-generation, open-source Learning Management System** designed with modern technology, clean architecture, and a beautiful user experience.
Fully self-hostable, modular, extendable, and built for developers who want an LMS that feels like a 2025 product.

---

# 🎯 **Project Goals**

## 1. **Create a Clean, Modern, Well-Designed LMS**

The core goal is to build an LMS that looks and feels truly modern:

* polished interface
* responsive, mobile-ready
* smooth interactions
* thoughtfully designed screens
* clear visual hierarchy

The design should feel inviting, intuitive, and professional.

---

## 2. **Use a Modern, Scalable Tech Stack**

### **Backend — Motia Framework**

* modular architecture
* API-first approach (REST/GraphQL)
* type-safe request/response pipeline
* clean separation of services
* real-time friendly
* easy to extend

### **Frontend — Next.js / React**

* fast server components
* reusable UI primitives
* modern design system
* optimized for performance
* SEO-ready public pages

### **Infrastructure**

* PostgreSQL
* Redis (cache, sessions, queues)
* Object storage (S3 compatible)
* Docker for deployment

---

## 3. **Clear, Modular Architecture**

The system should be:

* easy to read
* easy to extend
* easy to debug
* consistent across modules

Modules will include:

* authentication
* courses
* lessons
* quizzes
* progress tracking
* analytics
* payments (optional plugin)
* notifications

Each module should be self-contained and predictable.

---

## 4. **Fully Self-Hostable**

The platform should be trivial to run anywhere:

* one-command Docker setup
* works locally
* works on any server
* no cloud vendor lock-in
* fully open APIs

The goal is maximum control and simplicity.

---

## 5. **Plugin & Extension System**

The LMS will support an ecosystem of optional extensions:

* payment integrations
* AI helpers
* analytics dashboards
* quiz engines
* certification features
* integrations with external tools

The idea is to make the core small and extensible.

---

## 6. **User-Friendly Learning Experience**

The LMS should support smooth learning workflows:

* video lessons
* text lessons
* attachments
* progress tracking
* quizzes and assignments
* learner dashboards
* instructor dashboards

All focused on clarity and ease of use.

---

## 7. **Marketplace-Ready (Optional)**

The system will optionally support:

* public course catalog
* categories
* tags
* reviews
* instructor onboarding
* enrollments

These features are separate from the core and can be enabled or disabled.

---

## 8. **AI-Ready Architecture (Optional)**

AI features will be optional modules:

* generate quizzes
* summarize lessons
* recommend content
* transcribe videos
* analytics insights

The core should remain lightweight even without them.

---

## 9. **Open-Source Community Driven**

The project aims to be:

* well-documented
* easy to contribute to
* transparent
* open to discussion and proposals

With clear standards:

* coding guidelines
* API conventions
* module structure
* versioning
* roadmap

---

# 🏗️ **Current Status**

**Planning & Architecture Phase**

* designing backend module layout
* defining database schema
* sketching interfaces and flows
* preparing a design system
* creating project scaffolding

---
